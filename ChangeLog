Added -p (--preserve) option.  This is used to create .orig files in case
there would be overwriting (the default).

Added support for --hg (--mercurial) and --svn (--subversion) options.
Now renaming can happen in your favorite repository system.  There is
also the new --dot-paths option to control hidden subdirectory recursion.
Finally, the manual page has been updated with some examples.
