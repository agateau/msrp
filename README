msrp by Rudi Cilibrasi <cilibrar@cilibrar.com>

The Meta Search and Replace (msrp) is a simple utility that lets you
quickly rename symbols or functions or classes or anything using
Perl 5 compatible regular expressions.  msrp is a time saver because it
applies your substitution to both the contents of files as well as the
filenames themselves.  This means that msrp can be used in most modern
programming languages and programming frameworks where filenames (part
of file metadata) are used to indicate certain correspondances with
source code symbols.  If the filenames and source symbols must be
kept consistent or changed consistently, then msrp is the ideal tool.
Most languages that support modules embedded in filesystems also have
this same kind of semantic entanglement.

Here are some examples of languages or frameworks that can benefit from
msrp functionality:

C/C++ programming (.h files are usually named similar to type names)
Ruby on Rails (model names must match model filenames, same with views)
Java programming (renaming classes via regular expression en masse)
Debian packaging ( cp -rv ../debian . &&  msrp oldpkgname newpkgname debian/ )
