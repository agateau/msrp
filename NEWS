Improvements in 0.9.5:
======================

* msrp relies on PCRE to do regexp-matching and is limited to \0..\9 in back-regexp-ing.

Now one can also use the current file name (via '\f') in both search and replace strings.

For example: imagine a file 'file.cc' containing:
//// \file $ID$ 

after calling 'msrp -f -d "[$]ID[$]" "\f" file.cc' it will look as follows:
//// \file file.cc 

* one can also use the following escape sequences now: \n = end-of-line & \r = carrage-return

* While renaming files which are under some VCS one should better try using the VCS-specific command:

  * If the command fails msrp will fall-back to the usual plain rename command.
  * Additionally to --svn and --hg we support --git and --bzr now!

* msrp should be compilable under Linux, Mac OS X, AIX, cygwin etc.
Please try to build it and let us know about your experience!

* Additionally to autotools we have got cmake build system. 
Please check it out and let us know about your experience!


Any feedback is welcome! Pleas don't hesitate to post to our mailing list!

ps: we are currently looking for packagers!
