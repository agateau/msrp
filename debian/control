Description: meta search and replace tool for both filenames and files
 msrp is a data and metadata search and replacement tool.  It easily
 changes filenames and file contents for all listed command line arguments
 recursively.  It can help you to rename your symbols in your favorite
 programming languages, and help you avoid renaming all your files by hand
 each time you decide to change a function, variable, or class name.  It
 supports Perl 5 regular expressions with backsubstitution using \.
